[Inclusive Express AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yd8-qJpBL6Y)

Inclusive Express AI is an AI-powered, voice-driven Add-on for Adobe Express that helps anyone ‚Äî regardless of ability, technical skill, or experience ‚Äî create stunning, accessible designs simply by speaking.

Millions of people, including parents, teachers, community leaders, and individuals with disabilities, struggle with design tools due to complexity, time constraints, or accessibility limitations. Inclusive Express AI eliminates those barriers, enabling effortless, inclusive design for all.

## What It Does

Inclusive Express AI integrates directly into Adobe Express, providing:

-  **Voice-Driven Design Interaction** ‚Äî Users speak naturally, and the AI listens, understands, and generates designs  
-  **Built-in Accessibility Features** ‚Äî The Add-on applies WCAG accessibility standards like proper color contrast, readable fonts, and layout improvements  
-  **Conversational AI Intelligence** ‚Äî Using OpenAI‚Äôs API, the AI understands complex requests, asks follow-up questions, and personalizes design suggestions  
-  **Real-Time Design Preview** ‚Äî See live updates as you interact with the Add-on through voice  
-  **Inclusive for All Users** ‚Äî Designed for parents, teachers, busy individuals, and disabled users who need simple, effective design tools  
-  **Hands-Free Control** ‚Äî Users with mobility or visual impairments can design without using traditional input methods

##  How It Works

1. Launch Inclusive Express AI within Adobe Express  
2. The AI assistant welcomes the user with a voice prompt  
3. The user describes their design needs (e.g., "Create a colorful flyer for our school fundraiser, accessible to elderly parents")  
4. The AI processes the request with speech recognition, applies accessibility best practices, and shows a real-time design preview  
5. OpenAI's API powers conversational intelligence ‚Äî the AI provides suggestions, asks clarifying questions, and guides the user to completion  
6. Users can continue editing by voice or finalize the design with confidence
